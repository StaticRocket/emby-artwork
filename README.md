<h1 align="center">Emby Artwork Repository</h1>

This project contains an archive of studio images created by [Emby](https://emby.media/).
The upstream source is available at [github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Resources](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby.Resources).

If you would like to contribute to a new set of studio images under a Creative Commons license, an effort to replace these images has been started in the [Jellyfin Artwork Repository](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-artwork) project.
